## 2026-08-02 — The Pi runs containers it did not build, and holds no state inside them

**Context.** Issue #26: move the service off a developer laptop onto a Raspberry Pi 3 B (Raspberry
Pi OS Lite 64-bit) so it runs unattended. Three containers — the controller, Home Assistant, and an
MQTT broker. The board has **1 GB of RAM, an SD card, and an arm64 CPU**, and all three constraints
shaped the design.

**Decision 1 — CI builds the image; the Pi only pulls.** A `dotnet restore` + `publish` on a 1 GB
Pi 3 B takes tens of minutes and can be OOM-killed. GitHub Actions builds `linux/arm64` and pushes to
GHCR; the Pi runs `docker compose pull`. `sha-<short>` tags make a rollback a one-line command.

**Decision 2 — cross-compile, don't emulate.** The obvious way to build arm64 on an amd64 runner is
QEMU, which works and is roughly ten times slower. Instead the SDK stage is pinned to the *builder's*
architecture (`FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM`) and targets the other one via `dotnet publish -a
$TARGETARCH`, so the compiler runs natively and only the output is arm64. The runtime stage was then
written with **no `RUN` instruction at all** — the logs directory is created in the build stage and
`COPY --chown` sets ownership — so nothing arm64 ever executes at build time and the workflow needs
no QEMU setup step. Measured: 75 s for a cold cross-build, of which the publish itself is 3.5 s.

**Decision 3 — the Debian runtime image, not chiseled.** Chiseled is ~80 MB smaller, but it omits
tzdata and a shell. Log timestamps and `SolarForecast.ForDate` are timezone-sensitive, and this is a
headless box where the diagnostic path is `docker exec`. The disk saving is not worth either.

**Decision 4 — no state inside any container.** Every container must be destroyable with
`docker rm -f` and recreated with no loss; that is what makes upgrade and rollback routine rather
than risky. All state is on **bind mounts under `/opt/solax`** — chosen over named volumes because
the data is then visible to ordinary shell tools over SSH, without `docker volume inspect`
indirection. The consequence accepted: bind mounts carry host uids, so the deploy documents chowning
`logs/` to 1654 (the .NET image's non-root user) and `mosquitto/` to 1883.

**Decision 5 — the production broker authenticates.** The dev stack's `allow_anonymous true` is not
carried over. These topics include the charge-mode select and the battery-hold switch, so anonymous
access is control of the inverter and charger. The broker also publishes **no host port** — only the
compose network reaches it. No application change was needed: `HomeAssistantOptions` already had
optional `Username`/`Password`, previously unused.

**Consequences.**

- **1 GB is the binding constraint, and Home Assistant is the risk.** Per-service `mem_limit`s
  (600/200/48 MB) leave ~170 MB for the OS. They only take effect if cgroup memory accounting is
  enabled in `cmdline.txt`, which Raspberry Pi OS ships **off** — an easy silent failure, so it is
  step 3 of the setup. If HA cannot be made to fit, the fallback is moving it to another host; the
  three services are independent precisely so that stays a compose edit.
- **SD-card wear is the long-term failure mode.** Container logs are size-capped, the broker logs to
  stdout rather than its own file, and the seeded HA `recorder` config uses `purge_keep_days: 3` with
  `commit_interval: 30`.
- **Serilog's `SelfLog` is now enabled** (`Program.cs`), the one `src/` change the deployment forced.
  Verified: with a logs bind mount the non-root user cannot write, the file sink fails and the
  process carries on — console logging normal, container healthy, `docker diff` empty, and the log
  files silently never created. That is the exact failure a bind mount invites (Docker auto-creates a
  missing mount source as root), so it must not be silent. `deploy.sh` also refuses to deploy when
  the directory's ownership is wrong, catching it before the stack starts rather than a month later.
- **The controller is stateless, which costs one Solcast call per restart** — the forecast cache is
  in-memory. Normal operation is unaffected, but a crash-restart loop burns the free-tier daily quota,
  so restart counts are worth watching. Persisting the forecast is a possible follow-up.
- **Deployment writes nothing to hardware.** `ChargeControl` and `BatteryHold` stay at their shipped
  defaults; the compose file passes them explicitly so that is visible rather than implied.

## 2026-07-29 — A failed Modbus exchange invalidates the connection

**Context.** Issue #24: after roughly fifteen minutes of normal operation the service began failing
every single poll with `Response was not of expected transaction ID. Expected 2426, received 2424`,
and never recovered — 45 further minutes produced zero successful polls. Earlier logs show the same
failure in smaller doses going back a week.

**What was found.** A Modbus TCP response that arrives after its request has given up stays in the
socket's receive buffer. The next request reads *that* reply, and every request after it is
permanently one or more responses behind. NModbus retries a mismatch by re-sending, which heals a
one-off glitch — but not this, because every subsequent response is offset too, so the retries are
exhausted and the read throws.

The connection is not the problem. Throughout all of it the TCP socket is open and healthy, so
`ModbusTcpClient.IsConnected` returns true and the callers' `if (!IsConnected) ConnectAsync()` guard
never fires. The poll loop dutifully catches the exception, logs it, and retries on the same poisoned
stream, forever. Only restarting the process cleared it.

**Decision.** Any failed exchange invalidates the connection: the master and the `TcpClient` are
disposed and nulled, so the next call reconnects with a fresh stream and a fresh transaction counter.
This is done in an exception filter, so the original NModbus exception still reaches the caller and
the logs unchanged.

Three supporting changes:

- **Connect on demand.** Operations no longer throw "not connected"; they connect if needed. The
  callers' explicit guards still work but are no longer load-bearing.
- **One request at a time,** via a `SemaphoreSlim`. Requests are sequential today, but a reconnect can
  now happen mid-call, and two requests sharing a stream is another route to the same desync.
- **A minimum gap between requests** (`DeviceConfig.MinRequestInterval`). The SolaX protocol documents
  a second between instructions — a constraint noted in `InverterRegisterMap`'s own comment and then
  honoured nowhere. The poll loop issues about five requests per five-second cycle, four of them to
  the charger, which is where the failure was observed.

**Why 250 ms and not the documented second.** A full second across four charger requests would consume
most of a five-second poll. Recovery no longer depends on the spacing, so this value only affects how
often the device is pushed into a state that needs recovering; it is per-device configuration, and
raising it to `00:00:01` is the first thing to try if desyncs persist on other hardware.

**Consequences.**

- A transient glitch now costs one request instead of the process. The poll loop's existing
  catch-log-retry becomes sufficient rather than futile.
- Reconnection is invisible to callers, so a burst of failures shows up as a few warnings rather than
  an outage — worth remembering when reading logs: absence of errors no longer proves the link was
  never disturbed.
- Testing this needed a real socket. `FakeModbusTcpServer` speaks just enough MBAP to answer reads and
  writes and, on demand, to answer them with the wrong transaction id. Verified as a genuine
  regression test: with the invalidation disabled, three of the nine tests fail.

## 2026-07-26 — Battery discharge hold uses computed Power Control, not a device "No Discharge" mode

**Context.** Issue #20 asks for a switch that stops the home battery discharging, so an EV charges
from PV and grid but never from the battery, while the battery is still free to charge from PV
surplus. The issue proposed writing `power_control = Enabled No Discharge` to the Modbus Power
Control block at holding register `0x7C`, treating it as a fire-and-forget command: one write to arm
it for 8 hours, one write to release it, and nothing in between.

**What we found.** Desk verification against the upstream
[`plugin_solax.py`](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus/blob/main/custom_components/solax_modbus/plugin_solax.py)
map — the source the issue itself cites — contradicts that design in three places.

1. **`Enabled No Discharge` is not a device-level mode.** The `remotecontrol_power_control` entity is
   declared `WRITE_DATA_LOCAL`, meaning its option values (`11`, `12`, `110`, `120`, `130`) never
   reach the inverter — they are identifiers for client-side strategies. The device enum is only
   `0 = Disabled` and `1 = Enabled Power Control` (upstream lists `2 = Quantity Control` and
   `3 = SOC Target Control`, both commented out). Mode 8/9 at `0xA0` tells the same story: its
   `85: "Enabled No Discharge"` also resolves to a real device value of `8`.

2. **`active_power` is the mechanism, not an ignored field.**
   `autorepeat_function_remotecontrol_recompute` translates `Enabled No Discharge` into
   `power_control = Enabled Power Control` with `active_power = -min(house_load, pv_power)`. Because
   that target is derived from live house load and PV, it must be recomputed and rewritten
   continuously. A single 8-hour arming cannot express it.

3. **The block cannot be read back.** Holding register `0x7C` is overloaded: upstream *writes* the
   power-control command there but *reads* it as the inverter's ARM firmware version
   (`async_read_holding_registers(address=0x7B, count=2)`). No register exposes the active
   remote-control state — upstream tracks it with client-side timers only.

**Decision.** Implement the hold the way the hardware actually supports it: write
`power_control = Enabled Power Control` with `active_power = -min(house load, PV)`, recomputed each
poll from telemetry, and reissued when the target moves past a threshold or the armed command nears
expiry. This preserves both halves of the requirement — the battery is never asked to serve load
(the inverter is only ever told to push out power it is already generating), and PV beyond the house
load has nowhere to go but the battery, so surplus charging still works.

Consequences, deliberately accepted:

- **The "at most one write per 8 hours" acceptance criterion is dropped.** The write rate is instead
  bounded by `BatteryHold:TargetChangeThresholdWatts` (default 100 W) and the renewal interval. The
  command is not EEPROM-backed — upstream states these may be issued as often as desired — so this
  costs Modbus traffic, not hardware wear.
- **`Duration` is 60 s, not 8 hours.** With per-poll reconciliation a short duration is a *better*
  failsafe: if the service stops, the inverter resumes normal operation within a minute instead of
  within eight hours. Renewal happens at half the duration so a slow poll never leaves a gap. The
  8-hour figure survives only as the hardware ceiling (`u16`, 28,800 s) enforced in the encoder.
- **The Home Assistant switch reports our own armed state, not a device read-back.** The acceptance
  criteria around reading the hold back, surviving a restart by reading device state, and correcting
  a manual change made in the SolaX app are not implementable — and the last is moot anyway, since
  this is a command rather than a stored setting the app could show or alter.
- **Upstream's SOC ≥ 98 % branch is not implemented.** There, the target becomes
  `-pv_power - 150`, deliberately trickle-discharging the battery to keep SOC near 98 % and stop
  older inverters curtailing PV. That contradicts this issue's "battery power is never negative"
  requirement, so it is left out pending observation of whether PV curtailment actually occurs on
  this hardware.

**Why not the alternatives.** Unchanged from the issue, and reinforced by the above:

| Approach | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Computed Power Control (`0x7C`, mode 1) | **Chosen.** The only route that both blocks discharge and preserves PV → battery charging. Not EEPROM-backed. |
| Raise discharge cut-off / min SOC | Rejected. Modifies a stored parameter on a ~100,000-cycle EEPROM, 1 % granular, and drifts as SOC moves. |
| Battery Discharge Max Current = 0 | Rejected. Same EEPROM problem; also fights the inverter's own limits. |
| Manual Mode → "Stop charge and discharge" | Rejected. Freezes the battery in *both* directions, so PV surplus exports instead of charging the battery. Remains the manual fallback if the Modbus route fails verification. |

### Verified on hardware, 2026-07-27

First live write to the inverter. Conditions: dusk, PV ~360 W, SOC 87 %, no EV charging, house load
~1.5–2.9 kW.

**The mechanism works.** Arming the hold moved the house from battery to grid within one poll:

| | Battery | Grid | Solar |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before the write | **−2846 W** (discharging) | 0 W | 366 W |
| After the write | **−56 W** | **+1601 W** (importing) | 370 W |

Confirmed by this run:

- **`power_control = 1` with a computed `active_power` is accepted** and takes effect immediately —
  no Modbus exception, no rejected block. The encoded payload
  `[1,1,65170,65535,0,0,60,0,0,0,0,0,0]` at `0x7C` is correct as written.
- **Renewal at half the duration works.** Renewals were issued at ~33 s and ~72 s with the hold
  remaining continuously effective; no lapse or gap was observed between them.
- **PV was not curtailed.** Solar held steady at 358–370 W across the whole run, before, during and
  after arming. Weak evidence at 360 W in the evening — this needs repeating under strong midday sun
  before the curtailment risk can be closed.

**A working hold still leaves a residual 50–65 W trickle out of the battery.** This is inverter
standby draw, not load being served — it persisted regardless of house load swinging between 143 W
and 2877 W. Two consequences:

- Issue #20's acceptance criterion "`BatteryPowerWatts` is never negative" is **not literally
  achievable** on this hardware. The achievable guarantee is that the battery stops serving house
  load, which is what the feature is actually for.
- The "hold armed but battery discharging" warning originally triggered on any negative value, so it
  fired every single poll and drowned out the signal it existed to give. It now uses a 150 W deadband.

**Still to observe:** behaviour under strong PV (does the battery still charge from surplus while
held, and is PV curtailed at full output), behaviour with the EV actually charging, and what the
undocumented `timeout` field does relative to `duration`.

`BatteryHold:Enabled` remains off by default and `DryRun` still defaults to `true`, since none of the
above has been observed on any other firmware.
